         it can do things like clear out it's view, etc). */

Now, assuming the backgrounds of the views match we can swap in the destination (with no visual effect - so it all looks like one controller) and allow it to animate it's elements on screen.

So we'll simultaneously give our source time to clean up after transitioning to the destination, tell the destination to perform any 'complete animations/work' and tell the context we're finished.
