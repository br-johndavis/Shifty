/** An object that is capable of performing a 'Continuity' transition.
 
 At it's most basic a continuity transition follows a baic prcoess. First, the transition will briefly allow the source to prepare for the transition. When the source has completed it's preparations, the transition will swap out the view controllers and allow the destination the opportunity to complete the transition.

    ///
    /// - parameter destination: The view controller being transitioned to.
    /// - parameter duration:    The duration of the transition alloted to the preparation. Not obeying this duration can lead to animation skips.
    /// - parameter completion:  The closure to be executed at the end of the preparations. Failure to execute this closure will break the transition.
